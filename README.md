```
http://localhost:8000/controller.html
```

### 3. Set up the Overlay in vMix/OBS

#### For OBS:
1. Add a new "Browser Source"
2. Set the URL to: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
3. Set Width: `1920` and Height: `1080`
4. Check "Refresh browser when scene becomes active"

#### For vMix:
1. Add Input â†’ Web Browser
2. Set the URL to: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay not updating in vMix/OBS
1. Make sure both the controller and overlay are using the same localhost address
2. Try refreshing the browser source in vMix/OBS
3. Check that the local server is still running

### Teams/scores not showing
1. Make sure you've clicked "Setup Battle" after selecting teams
2. Check the controller for any error messages
3. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading

### Fonts not loading
Make sure the `fonts/` folder is in the same directory as the HTML files.

## Technical Notes

- The system now uses **server-based communication** instead of localStorage for OBS/vMix compatibility
- Data is exchanged via HTTP API endpoints (`/api/data` and `/api/animation`)
- Polling occurs every 100ms for responsive updates
- Data is stored in JSON files on the server
- The overlay starts visible by default for streaming software compatibility
- Works reliably across different browser engines (regular browsers, OBS CEF, vMix browsers)
